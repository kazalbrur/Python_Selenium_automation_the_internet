## Introduction

In the world of web development and software testing, automated testing is integral for ensuring the reliability and functionality of applications. This project focuses on automating tests for [the-internet.herokuapp.com](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com), a platform designed for practicing and showcasing different web elements and scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify that your web application works seamlessly across different browsers.
- **Element Interaction**: Learn how to interact with various HTML elements using Selenium WebDriver.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Understand and implement the Page Object Model for better test structure and maintainability.
- **Unit Test Framework**: Explore test case organization using the unittest framework in Python.

## Project Structure

The project contains scripts for automating different scenarios on the internet test site. The key directories and files include:

- **Test Scripts**: Scripts for automating and testing different functionalities such as:
  - Add/Remove Elements
  - Authentication
  - Broken Images
  - Checkboxes
  - Context Menus
  - Drag and Drop
  - Dropdowns
  - File Upload/Download
  - JavaScript Alerts
  - Key Presses
  - Sliders
  - Hover actions
  - Infinite Scroll, etc.

   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running Normal Test Scripts

To use the scripts with a normal structure:

1. Copy the content of a test script file (e.g., `add_remove_elements.py`).
2. Paste it into a new Python file (e.g., `my_script.py`).
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python my_script.py
   ```

### Running Unit Tests

For unit testing scripts, follow these steps:

1. Copy the content of a unit test script (e.g., `add_remove_elements_unittest.py`).
2. Paste it into a new Python file (e.g., `my_unittest_script.py`).
3. Run the test:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest my_unittest_script.py
   ```

You can also customize the scripts as needed for your own testing scenarios.
